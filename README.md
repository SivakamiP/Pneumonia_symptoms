# Pneumonia Classifier: Bacterial or Viral #
This project is a simple pneumonia classifier web application built using Streamlit. The application predicts whether a patient has bacterial or viral pneumonia based on a set of symptoms and also Using deep learning to classify pneumonia aims to create a sophisticated model that improves diagnostic precision and pneumonia early
detection from medical imaging data, including chest X-rays and CT scans.
