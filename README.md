# Pneumonia Classifier: Bacterial or Viral #
This project is a simple pneumonia classifier web application built using Streamlit. The application predicts whether a patient has bacterial or viral pneumonia based on a set of symptoms and also Using deep learning to classify pneumonia aims to create a sophisticated model that improves diagnostic precision and pneumonia early detection from medical imaging data, including chest X-rays and CT scans.



# Model Performance #
After we trained the model using CNN method we have obtained an accuracy of 69% and weighted F1 score of 66.73%. Our study's findings highlight the potential of deep
learning to improve the classification of pneumonia based on images, opening up exciting new possibilities for improving patient care and diagnostic capacity in
healthcare systems.
